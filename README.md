Warp-gbos is a group of programs to convert scanned map sheets into rectified KML files or slippy map tiles. An alternative is to use Metacarta and Geothing to display rectified/warped images. Warp-gbos supports higher resolution images than is allowed by web based services. Various transformations are available at high accuracy:

* British national grid reference system to Rectified Mercator
* British national grid reference system to Rectified British national grid reference system
* Mercator to Rectified Mercator

If there is any demand, I can add the function of Mercator to Rectified British national grid reference system.

These tools were developed to rectify 7th Series OS maps into a usable form. They were originally created by TimSC. A large amount of computer memory is required to manipulate very large map scans. The tools operate on the command line and require some knowledge of common commands.
